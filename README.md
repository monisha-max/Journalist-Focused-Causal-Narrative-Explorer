This image represents a dynamic causal graph illustrating relationships between events extracted from Reuters news articles. Each node in the graph represents a specific event enriched with its associated sentiment—positive, neutral, or negative—while the edges depict causal connections inferred from the text. The visualization provides a storytelling perspective, showing how one event can lead to or influence another, capturing global events' interconnectedness through natural language processing and network analysis.

This image presents a constructed timeline of events using a climate dataset related to disasters and significant environmental milestones. It includes dates and times for various events, highlighting key historical moments, scientific advancements, and climate-related impacts. The timeline serves as a visual representation of data that can be utilized for climate research, disaster analysis, and environmental studies.

It is the construction and visualization of causal chains from a given dataset, showcasing relationships between variables. The code generates a causal graph, where nodes represent entities or events and directed edges indicate causal relationships. This structure helps visualize how one event influences another, making complex causal dependencies easier to understand. The output of the analysis is a video that illustrates the evolution of these causal chains.

The video animation plays through 120 frames at 30 frames per second, effectively demonstrating the step-by-step emergence of causal relationships within the data. The visual representation is designed to highlight key pathways, helping users see not only individual causal links but also how they connect to form larger chains. This visual approach aids in interpreting the data and making informed decisions based on the identified causal structures.
